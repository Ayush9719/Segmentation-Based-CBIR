# Shape-Based-CBIR
### This is our attempt to improve the standard CBIR model for cytological image

The standard CBIR model for cytological images was based on texture features like Tamura Features or Autocorrelogram.
In this project, we attempted to use the best segmentation method available for these images and extracted the shape features as our image descriptors.
We found that our model was faster then the standard models.
